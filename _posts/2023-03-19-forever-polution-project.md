I came across this topic in a recent LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danieldrepper_wir-haben-monatelang-an-einem-projekt-gearbeitet-activity-7034453375794470912-CrkV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by investigative journalist [Daniel Drepper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldrepper/). An international research network investigated the spread of [PFAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per-_and_polyfluoroalkyl_substances) (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) to unveil the scale of pollution. This group of chemicals are linked to various deseases such as cancer and infertility. As a result, PFAS are estimated to account for 52 and 84 billion euros in costs for European health systems â€“ each year. Making this thread tarnsparent to the public is the aim of the [Forever Pollution Project](https://foreverpollution.eu/). 

I built a Shiny app that allows to 
- quickly get an **overview** about the *entire* dataset; that is, all 33 countries instead of just Germany, for example,
- **filter** for specific characteristics (only groundwater sites in Hamburg, Germany),
- access all information for a **specific site**, and
- come across **biases and flaws** in the data.
