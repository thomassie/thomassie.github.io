It happens from time to time that I'm using datasets which include physical addesses that need to be turned into longitude/latitude data. For example, when working data of [mass shootings](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/mass-shooting) in the US the [Gun Violence Archive GVA](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) provides physical addresses only.
