It happens from time to time that I'm using datasets which include physical addesses that need to be turned into longitude/latitude data. For example, when working data of [mass shootings](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/mass-shooting) in the US the [Gun Violence Archive GVA](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) provides physical addresses only. 

So, how to get long/lat data? Well, there are many solution out there. However, `tidygeocoder` is by far the most convenient one to get the job done. The package was developped by [Jesse Cambon](https://jessecambon.github.io), [Diego Hernang√≥mez](https://github.com/dieghernan), [Christopher Belanger](https://github.com/chris31415926535) and [Daniel Possenriede](https://github.com/dpprdan). I especially like that it allows you to chose your service or 'method' of choice. You may use ones that don't require any API key, such as [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org) or [ArcGis](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/overview-world-geocoding-service.htm), or others that do, such as [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview?hl=de) or [TomTom](https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/search-api-documentation).

I tried, both, Nominatim (`method = "osm"`) and ArcGis (`method = "arcgis"`) and checked the results. While Nominatim was failing quite often with an address value like `2746 Fleur Dr., Des Moines, Iowa`, ArcGis found all long/lat data as well as the other details that are possible to retrieve (`full_results = TRUE`).
