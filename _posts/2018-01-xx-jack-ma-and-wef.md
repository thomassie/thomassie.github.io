The recent world economic forum in Davos brought together some of the most powerful and influential people from politics and economics – just like every year. I will not discuss the meaning or purpose of these meetings, nor the people that attend it. Rather, I would like to share my thoughts about a couple of things that came to my mind when I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9ENp2BQ8lE) interview with
[Jack Ma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ma).

**The use of technology.**  

Like so often, it seems that our future well-being lies within our technological progress. Jack Ma, and I believe many others, too, obviously believe that only technology provides the answers to the pressing problems we face right now. Really? Is it that old inherent promise that technology will somehow solve poverty, pollution, diseases and anything else keeping us away from living a happy life?

I guess it is absolutely fine to state that technology increased our overall wealth and improved our health (i.e., life expectancy). 

It is about the 'why' we are inventing things. Sure, we try to overcome anything that fatally affects our health. That is why we do research on how to cure certain diseases, regenerate from

We cannot even design operating systems that are 100 % safe. Why do we assume, despite being fully aware of this, that operating systems for autonomous cars cannot be hacked? I do not get that. Well, I admit that I do not know much about the technology behind autonomous driving.  

If I out myself in the position of a perverted terrorist aiming to kill as many people as possible, I guess one of my first choices would be to hack autonomously driving cars and trucks and let them collide on highways, for instance.

**Anticipating upcoming social and environmental issues.**   

**Influencing the future.**  
"You can achieve anything." (super optimistic) vs.
"It will come. Whether you like it or not." (could not be more pessimistic)

**Philanthropy – and where the money comes from.**  
When I go to museums, zoos and so on I realise that very often parts of them (or sometimes even entire museums) are funded by financial institutions, pharmaceutical companies or private persons. That might seem to be something good and appreciable. And actually, I think it is. Returning a bit of the money you earned to the society that you also benefit from is good, no doubt.

However, I find myself often pondering about where the money comes from, that is, how it was generated.

Super rich people spending money
Relative vs. absolute.

Purpose? In what kind of projects do philanthropists spend their money? And how influential
are these projects?
From my own experience when living in [Potsdam](https://www.google.ch/maps/place/Potsdam,+Germany/@52.4364686,13.2160877,29385m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a8f5cd843ad6b7:0xc565f8980baaec9b!8m2!3d52.3905689!4d13.0644729) (Brandenburg, Germany) I can say that active, committed philanthropists
are good, since they often serve as the initial spark or final financial support
to realise certain projects. But there is also a flip side. And this is not even about where
the money comes from. It is more about the impression that cash-strapped communities rely a bit
on these private persons to fund institutes, museums, listed buildings and whatnot.

In Potsdam, I actually appreciated that [Günther Jauch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Günther_Jauch),
a well know TV personality in German speaking countries, put a lot of money into restoring
the [Marmorpalais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmorpalais), for example.
Or [Hasso Plattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasso_Plattner),
co-founder of SAP and multi-billionaire, put vast amounts of money in his hands to
fund the [Hasso Plattner Institute](https://hpi.de) (HPI), which became one of Germany's
best IT colleges within a bit more than a decade. Also, he recently opened the
[Museum Barberini](https://www.museum-barberini.com/en/), built exclusively on his
expense (see articles in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/20/tech-billionaire-opens-new-potsdam-art-gallery)
or [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2017/01/boast-brandenburg)).

People clearly benefit from such projects, no doubt. But philanthropists also have
the means to shape communities/societies according to their notion. And that is fine because
it is their money. And it is fine as long as these projects really serve the majority of people (which actually makes them philanthropic),
or, whether it is simply a personal project. In latter case one cannot talk about philanthropists but rather investors.
This is why I think that each presumably philanthropic project should be part of a public discourse about the pros and cons and to see if the majority actually supports it. The discussion about rebuilding the historically controversial [Garnisonskirche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison_Church_(Potsdam)) in Postdam is a good example. But that is a personal and highly subjective point of view.  

**Why is it possible that single persons accumulate such an unimaginable wealth?**

That is a good question to me – and a hard one to answer. I believe that persons should not be able accumulate wealth that it is beyond the imagination of most others. I guess one answer is that we consider money as the means to realise our dreams and wishes. To most people the pursuit of happiness is directly linked to money. Which is absolutely okay up to a specific amount. You cannot tell people that are barely able to make a living (or not even such) that money is not everything. For many it is rather "first the grubs, then the morals". To set the amount of individual wealth which is still acceptable (from a moral and social peace perspective) is far from being easy. I could not do it. However, when considering the massive and completely unacceptable maldistribution of wealth we cannot agree and be happy that 1 percent of adults hold 50.1 percent of all household wealth in the world (according to [Credit Suisses's Global Wealth Report](https://www.credit-suisse.com/corporate/en/articles/news-and-expertise/global-wealth-report-2017-201711.html)). That is incredible and hard to swallow!

The Harry Gants (from Matt Ruff's [Sewer, Gas and Electric](https://www.amazon.de/Sewer-Gas-Electric-Public-Trilogy/dp/0802141552/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1518000670&sr=8-16&keywords=matt+ruff)) and others are not fictionally characters but real. We have Bill Gates (Microsoft), Warren Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Amancio Ortega (Zara), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) and so forth. Have a look at Forbes' list of the world's billionaires. It is a long list getting longer and longer. I guess for most people these billionaires serve as role models; not because of what they do, but because of what they possess.

Actually, that this is true for *most* people is just my personal impression derived from the attention we give them (see the next point). I have not done any research on this. But, let us assume that it is true. This would mean that the majority of people does not really care about how money is generated or earned, respectively, given the businesses many (or most?) billionaires follow. That is a problem. And it directly or indirectly rebounds upon us with respect to sustainability, (technological) progress, and social functioning. Because, if we do not care about how we earn money or which businesses we follow, we also do not care about our future because we set our priorities all wrong: money before well-being, before freedom, before equality, before peace. Progress is biased by the desire to gain wealth. A desire motivated by greed.

That might sound harsh and exaggerated. However, if you do not pay attention to the personal impacts of your actions this will have severe consequences for society. Reckless and ignorant behaviour might work out for a minority of individuals, and as long as the majority still accepts or tolerates its behavior a society can still thrive. However, under reverse conditions it will certainly fail. That is, we should be clear that these individuals with an intent only on personal well-being are not capable of dictating the course of a society.
Because I believe that personal credibility and integrity scale up and are reflected in the behaviour of a society I also believe that mankind can do much better than now. A redistribution of wealth (and power?) is is an important step in the right direction.


**Which are the people we listen to?**  
Why do we assume that (economically) successful people are worth listening to?
That is related to mainly two points: how people think about money, and the skills these
people have to get accumulate incredible amounts of money.





**Money as motivating force?**





**Final comment**

I am taking a bit the role of a pessimist, here. And I would be happy to discuss these topics with people having a much more optimistic view of them.
