## Since 2018...
...I'm working as a **data analyst** with [PwC](https://www.pwc.ch/en.html) in their Zurich office in Oerlikon. I'm part of a small data analysis team exclusively assigned to [Deals](https://www.pwc.ch/en/services/deals.html).  My tasks comprise (a) **designing visualisations** to communicate internal and client data efficiently and effectively - mostly in form of interactive dashboards using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), (b) **educating** the Deals team in various data analytics softwares and competencies, and (c) helping them with their **daily project work**.


## 2017: Personal sabbatical
For 1.5 years, I was taking a personal sabbatical to (a) spend more **time with my family**, (b) **educate myself** in topics I never really found the time before, and (c) figure out **what to do in the future**. I really enjoyed that break.


## 2012 – 2016: Postdoctoral researcher

<!--- In my postdoc project I dealed with the response behaviour of ecological communities to environmental changes. I approached this topic by performing experiments with microbial communities being . --->

* **Location**: [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) (Switzerland)
* **Project title**: _Predicting ecological responses to environmental change._
* **Supervisor**: [Prof. Owen L. Petchey](http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/staff/member/petchey_owen.htm)
* **Keywords**: bacteria · ciliates · community dynamics · functional responses · mathematical modelling · microcosm experiments · non-linear dynamics · paradox of enrichment · response to environmental changes · statistical modelling  


## 2006 – 2012: Doctoral thesis (PhD)

<!--- Phytoplankton consists of microorganisms mostly belonging to the realm of plants. --->

* **Ecology** (summa cum laude)
* **Location**: [University of Potsdam](http://www.uni-potsdam.de/) (Germany)
* **Project title**: _Dynamic behaviour of phytoplankton populations far from steady-state – chemostat experiments and mathematical modelling._
* **Supervisors**: [Prof. Ursula Gaedke](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/ibb-ecology/mitarbeiterinnen/prof-dr-ursula-gaedke.html) and [Prof. Bernd Blasius](https://www.icbm.de/mathematische-modellierung/)

* **Thesis**: [download](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/5618/file/massie_diss.pdf)  


## 2005: Diploma thesis (M.Sc.)

<!--- I received my diploma in Biology in 2005 by successfully graduating in the subjects Ecology & Nature conservation, Limnology, Microbiology, and Botany. In my diploma thesis I dealed with the occurence of harmful algae blooms (HABs), i.e., mass occurrences of specific (phyto-)plankton species that can cause harm to people and other species sharing the same environment. HABs occur almost everywhere on earth, in marine and fresh water environments. --->
