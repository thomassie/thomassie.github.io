## since 2023: comparis.ch
Since 2023, I'm working as a data analyst [CH Media](https://chmedia.ch)'s streaming platform [Oneplus](https://www.oneplus.ch/). My typical tasks comprise
- creating and managing datasets in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction?hl=de) directly from [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/transform?_gl=1*1tcvwp8*_up*MQ..&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIitn2nqWgjAMVxrxoCR1IMxzCEAAYASAAEgI9hvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&hl=en),
- performing various business intelligence taske ssuch a content performance or churn analytics,
- **loading data** from BigQuery and other sources into [R](https://www.r-project.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org) scripts,
- performing **explorative data analysis** in R/Python to **identify patterns/stories**,
- performing **various analysis** in R/Python to **test ideas** and produce stories,

## 2021 – 2023: comparis.ch
In 2021 I started working as a data analyst in [Comparis](https://www.comparis.ch)' newsroom team. My typical tasks comprise
- creating **SQL queries/views/tables** in [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/introduction?hl=de) via [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com),
- **loading data** from BigQuery and other sources into [R](https://www.r-project.org) or [Python](https://www.python.org) scripts,
- performing **explorative data analysis** in R/Python to **identify patterns/stories**,
- performing **various analysis** in R/Python to **test ideas** and produce stories,
- researching 3<sup>rd</sup>-party data to **enrich analysis** and **provide context**,
- using moderate **statistical models** to gain further **insights**,
- **visualising** results in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) of [plotly](https://plotly.com) (static/semi-interactive),
- **visualising** results in [Flourish](https://flourish.studio) for web (interactive),
- creating **interactive reports** ([Quarto](https://quarto.org) or [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)),
- creating **automated text blocks** for [press releases](https://www.comparis.ch/comparis/press/medienmitteilungen/archiv), and
- creating sophisticated and appealing **Tableau dashboards** as a **self-service** to inform subject matter experts.

comparis.ch is well known in Switzerland (at least 90% of people are aware of this platform and millions make use of it) and, hence, it is interesting and fun to see analysis performed in the newsroom being discussed by media and the public.

## 2020 – 2021: Further education
In 2020 I decided to dig deeper into the topics of **[full-stack development](https://learning.constructor.org/de/full-stack)** (front-end + back-end) and **[data science](https://learning.constructor.org/de/data-science)**. I decided to go with two bootcamps with [Constructor Learning](https://learning.constructor.org/de) (back than called Propulsion Acedemy). Although being tough from a time effort perspective, I enjoyed the time as the instructors are competent and very nice, and the topics covered allowed for a very good overview.

<br>
## 2018 – 2020: P*w*C
**Data analyst** with [P*w*C](https://www.pwc.ch/en.html) in their Zurich office in Oerlikon. I was part of a small data analytics team exclusively assigned to [Deals](https://www.pwc.ch/en/services/deals.html), i.e. mergers and acquisitions. Typical tasks comprised
- **collecting, wrangling and analyzing** client and internal data ([Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/de), R),
- **designing sophisticated dashboards** (Tableau, [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/de-ch/)) and other types of **data visualizations** that allow for an instant overview of the information available (R).
- working for **various lines of services** (strategy, financial services, corporate finance, valuations, real estate…) and **businesses/industries** (banking, retail, pharmaceuticals, healthcare…), and
- **educating business people** in data analytics software (Tableau, Alteryx, [PowerQuery](https://powerquery.microsoft.com/en-us/), [PowerPivot](https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/office/erste-schritte-mit-power-pivot-in-microsoft-excel-fdfcf944-7876-424a-8437-1a6c1043a80b)) and competencies (visualization techniques, storytelling, data wrangling…).
<!--My tasks comprise (a) **designing visualisations** to communicate internal and client data efficiently and effectively - mostly in form of interactive dashboards using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), (b) **educating** the Deals team in various data analytics softwares and competencies, and (c) helping them with their **daily project work**.-->

<br>
## 2017: Personal sabbatical
For 1.5 years, I was taking a personal sabbatical to (a) spend more **time with my family**, (b) **educate myself** in topics I never really found the time before, and (c) figure out **what to do in the future**. I really enjoyed that break.

## 2005: Diploma thesis (M.Sc.)

<!--- I received my diploma in Biology in 2005 by successfully graduating in the subjects Ecology & Nature conservation, Limnology, Microbiology, and Botany. In my diploma thesis I dealed with the occurence of harmful algae blooms (HABs), i.e., mass occurrences of specific (phyto-)plankton species that can cause harm to people and other species sharing the same environment. HABs occur almost everywhere on earth, in marine and fresh water environments. --->
