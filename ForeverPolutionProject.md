I came across this topic in a recent LinkedIn [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/danieldrepper_wir-haben-monatelang-an-einem-projekt-gearbeitet-activity-7034453375794470912-CrkV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by investigative journalist [Daniel Drepper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieldrepper/). An international research network investigated the spread of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) to unveil the scale of pollution. This group of chemicals are linked to various deseases such as cancer and infertility. As a result, PFAS are estimated to account for 52 and 84 billion euros in costs for European health systems â€“ each year. Making this thread tarnsparent to the public is the aim of the [Forever Pollution Project](https://foreverpollution.eu/). 

It was estimated that PFAS put a burden of between 52 and 84 billion euros on European health systems each year.
