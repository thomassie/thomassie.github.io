## What is Flourish?

[Flourish](https://flourish.studio) is an online visualisation tool. It allows to create interactive visualisations and stories without needing any coding skills. It offers a wide range of chart types, maps, and animations that can be customized to fit (almost) any data set. <!-- including standard chart types such as bar or line charts as well as maps and more complex charts. --> With Flourish, users can easily upload their own data to create engaging and informative visualisations. 

One of the biggest advantages of Flourish is its ease of use. The platform is quite intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to users of different skill levels. Additionally, Flourish offers a number of integrations, allowing users to easily embed their visualisations in websites.

Flourish allows for a wide range of interactive features and animations that can be added to charts and maps, including hover effects, click interactions, and animations. These interactive features enable users to create engaging and dynamic visualisations that respond to user input and make it easier to explore and understand data insights.

In addition to standard interactivity features, Flourish also offers more advanced interactive features like filters, sliders, and drop-down menus, which can be used to allow users to explore different aspects of the data set and customize the visualisation to their needs.

The platform offers a free plan that includes basic features, as well as paid plans for users who need more advanced functionality (e.g., custom templates).

Below, I will display a couple of visualisations – and also mention some of the drawbacks that you face when dealing with these using Flourish.

## Examples
<br>

### **Choropleth map**
...displaying key figures for Swiss municipalities.<br>
Everythings working as expected. That is, when hovering over a tile one can obtain a couple of statistics for the respective municipality. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/10105282"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<br>

...displaying most expensive and most modest-priced health insurances premiums in 2023 for adults with a deductibel of CHF 300.<br>
This is a more complex choropleth map than the one before. First, what is quite obvious is the possibility to adjust map colours. That is, one can choose to either colour the map by minimum or maximum premiums. This is achieved by including two columns as values for the map. In addition, the pop-up window or tooltip displays detailed informations regarding minimum and maximum premiums as well as the maximum savings potential – per month and year.
