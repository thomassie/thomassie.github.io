It boasts a wide range of chart types, maps, and animations, all of which can be customised to accommodate (almost) any data set.

Furthermore, Flourish provides a range of integrations, enabling users to embed their visualisations seamlessly into websites.

Flourish boasts an extensive selection of interactive features and animations that can be incorporated into charts and maps, including hover effects, click interactions, and animations.

## Examples
<br>

### **Choropleth map**
...displaying key figures for Swiss municipalities.<br><br>
Everything iss working as expected here. That is, when hovering over a tile one can obtain a couple of statistics for the respective municipality. Colors indicate that urban character a municipality has; white lines the borders between Swiss larger regions. Nothing more, nothing less.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/10105282"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<br>

...displaying most expensive and most modest-priced health insurances premiums in 2023 for adults with a deductibel of CHF 300.<br><br>
This is a more complex choropleth map than the previous one. First, what is quite evident is the capacity to adjust map colours. That is, one can choose to colour the map either by minimum or maximum premiums. This is achieved by including two columns that contain the values for colouring the map. Additionally, the pop-up window or tooltip displays detailed information regarding minimum and maximum premiums as well as the maximum potential savings – per month and year.<br><br>
For the most part, the map operates as expected, displaying all information accurately and adjusting the colours appropriately for low/high values. However, there are two points that are somewhat troublesome. First, when using the search field, it lists all values for the column in use. That is, when searching for a specific municipality, you will always see two names instead of just one, as it does not list unique values. Secondly, the search field persistently sits at the very top layer. This causes the visualisation to look a bit messy when the tooltip is overlaid by the search field.
